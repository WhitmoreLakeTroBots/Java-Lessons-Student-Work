# Java-Lessons-Student-Work

Repo for student work for Whitmore Lake Robotics Summer Programming class

This programming class is a beginning programmers with no programming experience.

The class uses Linux Mint 17.3 workstations using eclipse, bash and GIT.

  The first meeting is bash, GIT and the Linux terminal under the utilities lessons
  Lesson 1 is creating students branch and creating a first project
  Lesson 2 is basic inheritance and working with eclipse
  Lesson 3 is more advanced inheritance topics

  The goal of these lesson plans is to get the middle school students able to
  program at a basic FTC level.    


  This repository works in a way where each student clones the repository and
  creates a branch based on the first 4 letters of their last name and first 3
  letters of their first name... ie Bart Simpson will become SimpBar.   

  Each student will then have a private branch to work on and learns the basics
  of GIT while doing the coarse work.
