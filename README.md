# Java-Lessons-Student-Work

Repo for student work for Whitmore Lake Robotics Summer Programming class

This repository works in a way where each student clones the repository and
creates a branch based on the first 4 letters of their last name and first 3
letters of their first name... ie Bart Simpson will become SimpBar.   This gives
all students a space in the repository to store their class code.

Each student will then have a private branch to work on and learns the basics
of GIT while doing the course work.

This programming class is targeted for beginning programmers with no
programming experience.

The class uses Linux Mint 17.3 workstations using Eclipse, bash and GIT.

  The first session is bash, GIT and the Linux terminal under the utilities lessons

  Lesson 1 is creating students branch and creating a first eclipse project.

  Lesson 2 is basic inheritance and working with eclipse.

  Lesson 3 is more advanced inheritance topics.

  The goal of these lesson plans is to expose middle school students to
  Java Programming Basics
